This is another static website where I get to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Minimal JS this time.

I've learned about absolute and relative positioning, flexbox, image opacity, imported fonts, and most importantly, forms!

I will add the forms tomorrow. 

EDITED:

 I added the form! I styled it, used some JS to check for password matching, used valid/invalid and focus CSS pseudo-classes and some more advanced selectors, as well as html for styling.
